<h1>The Best Movies According to Diin</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>2001: A Space Odyssey</h3>
<p>Best Kubrick film. Love the aesthetic, the message, the tone and the significance it had.</p>
<h3>Blade Runner 2049</h3>
<p>One of the most visually appealing movies ever. Kept me engaged and enthralled throughout as I began to question what it means to be human.</p>
<h3>Memento</h3>
<p>A very uniquelly made movie, the story is told in a completely counter-intuitive way. Just as it intended to.</p>
